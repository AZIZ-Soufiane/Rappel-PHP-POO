Composer makes PHP projects modular and easy to manage.

Always define autoloading in composer.json â†’ saves you from messy require calls.

Run composer dump-autoload after changes in autoload config.

Use Composer scripts for shortcuts to your CLI commands.

"type": "project" is for apps, "library" is for reusable packages.

"license": "MIT" is a safe default for learning/demo projects.
